                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Simon Gao and I am a junior studying computer science at Stevens Institute of Technology.
                    I was born and raised in New Jersey for most of my childhood but my family is from China. I am turning 21 this upcoming December
                    so that should be a banger (just kidding we comply with COVID-19 social distancing guidelines). But I am looking forward to this upcoming year 
                    despite the current state of the world. More specifically, I am excited for this upcoming Summer because I hope to work at an internship for my last undergraduate summere
                    before graduation.
